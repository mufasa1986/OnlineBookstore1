BookZone

The “BookZone” project, is a simulated online bookstore, which was interactive and dynamic. It was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL technologies. It had a web user interface as a front-end, and a connected relational database (MySQL) as a back-end.
The website has five pages: a home page with a simple, minimalist and search-friendly interface. An “About us” page, “Add a book”, “Add a publisher”, and “Add a category”. The last three pages are for admins to update the back-end SQL database. 

Unique features: A dynamic “drop-down” list. That means every time the database is updated with a new book, category or publisher it automatically inserts it into the drop down list. 
A user can perform an exact search or a “loose” search. The "loose search" function searches for a string of letters; for example, selecting Title and typing in “php” will result in bringing up all titles with a consecutive string of the letters “php”.

Implementation: The relational SQL database has four tables, Books, Authors, Publishers, and Categories. These tables were stored in a MySQL database on the university server. The website pages were made using HTML and CSS, and embedded with PHP code. The PHP code interacted with the database to dynamically present new web pages to users according to their search requests.
